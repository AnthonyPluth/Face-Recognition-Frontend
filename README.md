# Face Recognition

## Prerequisites
The frontend application requires the backend python api to be running on localhost:5000.  Please clone the [backend repo](https://gitlab.com/abpluth/face-recognition-backend) and start the service before running the frontend.

## Frontend Setup
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Frontend
```bash
npm start
```

## Testing
```bash
npm test
npm run coverage
```

## How it works
This package will allow you to train and run facial recognition using your computer's webcam.
